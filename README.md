A Home Assistant custom Integration for local handling of Tuya-based devices.

This custom integration updates device status via push updates instead of polling, so status updates are fast (even when manually operated).

The following Tuya device types are currently supported:
* 1 and multiple gang switches
* Wi-Fi smart plugs (including those with additional USB plugs)
* Lights
* Covers
* Fans
* Climates (soon)

Energy monitoring (voltage, current, watts, etc.) is supported for compatible devices.

This repository's development began as code from [@NameLessJedi](https://github.com/NameLessJedi), [@mileperhour](https://github.com/mileperhour) and [@TradeFace](https://github.com/TradeFace). Their code was then deeply refactored to provide proper integration with Home Assistant environment, adding config flow and other features. Refer to the "Thanks to" section below.


# Installation:

Copy the localtuya folder and all of its contents into your Home Assistant's custom_components folder. This folder is usually inside your `/config` folder. If you are running Hass.io, use SAMBA to copy the folder over. If you are running Home Assistant Supervised, the custom_components folder might be located at `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant`. You may need to create the `custom_components` folder and then copy the localtuya folder and all of its contents into it

Alternatively, you can install localtuya through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) by adding this repository.


# Usage:

**NOTE: You must have your Tuya device's Key and ID in order to use localtuya. There are several ways to obtain the localKey depending on your environment and the devices you own. A good place to start getting info is https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md .**


**NOTE - Nov 2020: If you plan to integrate these devices on a network that has internet and blocking their internet access, you must also block DNS requests (to the local DNS server, e.g. 192.168.1.1). If you only block outbound internet, then the device will sit in a zombie state; it will refuse / not respond to any connections with the localkey. Therefore, you must first connect the devices with an active internet connection, grab each device localkey, and implement the block.**

Devices can be configured in two ways:

# Option one: YAML config files

Add the proper entry to your configuration.yaml file. Several example configurations for different device types are provided below. Make sure to save when you are finished editing configuration.yaml.

```yaml
localtuya:
  - host: 192.168.1.x

        color_temp_reverse: false # Optional, default: false
        color: 24 # Optional, usually 5 (RGB_HSV) or 24 (HSV), default: "none"
        brightness_lower: 29 # Optional, usually 0 or 29, default: 29
        brightness_upper: 1000 # Optional, usually 255 or 1000, default: 1000
        color_temp_min_kelvin: 2700 # Optional, default: 2700
        color_temp_max_kelvin: 6500 # Optional, default: 6500
        scene: 25 # Optional, usually 6 (RGB_HSV) or 25 (HSV), default: "none"
        music_mode: False # Optional, some use internal mic, others, phone mic. Only internal mic is supported, default: "False"

      - platform: sensor
        friendly_name: Plug Voltage
        id: 20
        scaling: 0.1 # Optional
        device_class: voltage # Optional
        unit_of_measurement: "V" # Optional

      - platform: switch
        friendly_name: Plug
        id: 1
        current: 18 # Optional
        current_consumption: 19 # Optional
        voltage: 20 # Optional
```

Note that a single device can contain several different entities. Some examples:
- a cover device might have 1 (or many) cover entities, plus a switch to control backlight
- a multi-gang switch will contain several switch entities, one for each gang controlled

Restart Home Assistant when finished editing.

# Option two: Using config flow

Start by going to Configuration - Integration and pressing the "+" button to create a new Integration, then select LocalTuya in the drop-down menu.
Wait for 6 seconds for the scanning of the devices in your LAN. Then, a drop-down menu will appear containing the list of detected devices: you can
select one of these, or manually input all the parameters.

> **Note: The tuya app on your device must beÂ closed for the following steps to work reliably.**

![discovery](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya-homeassistant/blob/master/img/1-discovery.png)

If you have selected one entry, you only need to input the device's Friendly Name and the localKey.

Setting the scan interval is optional, only needed if energy/power values are not updating frequently enough by default. Values less than 10 seconds may cause stability issues.

Once you press "Submit", the connection is tested to check that everything works.

Then, it's time to add the entities: this step will take place several times. First, select the entity type from the drop-down menu to set it up.
After you have defined all the needed entities, leave the "Do not add more entities" checkbox checked: this will complete the procedure.

![entity_type](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya-homeassistant/blob/master/img/3-entity_type.png)

For each entity, the associated DP has to be selected. All the options requiring to select a DP will provide a drop-down menu showing
all the available DPs found on the device (with their current status!!) for easy identification. Each entity type has different options
to be configured. Here is an example for the "switch" entity:

![entity](https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya-homeassistant/blob/master/img/4-entity.png)

Once you configure the entities, the procedure is complete. You can now associate the device with an Area in Home Assistant

# Energy monitoring values

You can obtain Energy monitoring (voltage, current) in two different ways:

1) Creating individual sensors, each one with the desired name.
  Note: Voltage and Consumption usually include the first decimal. You will need to scale the parament by 0.1 to get the correct values.
1) Access the voltage/current/current_consumption attributes of a switch, and define template sensors
  Note:  these values are already divided by 10 for Voltage and Consumption
1) On some devices, you may find that the energy values are not updating frequently enough by default. If so, set the scan interval (see above) to an appropriate value. Settings below 10 seconds may cause stability issues, 30 seconds is recommended.

```
       sensor:
         - platform: template
           sensors:
             tuya-sw01_voltage:
               value_template: >-
                 {{ states.switch.sw01.attributes.voltage }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'V'
             tuya-sw01_current:
               value_template: >-
                 {{ states.switch.sw01.attributes.current }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'mA'
             tuya-sw01_current_consumption:
               value_template: >-
                 {{ states.switch.sw01.attributes.current_consumption }}
               unit_of_measurement: 'W'
```

# Debugging

Whenever you write a bug report, it helps tremendously if you include debug logs directly (otherwise we will just ask for them and it will take longer). So please enable debug logs like this and include them in your issue:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.localtuya: debug
```

# Notes:

* Do not declare anything as "tuya", such as by initiating a "switch.tuya". Using "tuya" launches Home Assistant's built-in, cloud-based Tuya integration in lieu of localtuya.

# To-do list:

* Create a (good and precise) sensor (counter) for Energy (kWh) -not just Power, but based on it-.
      Ideas: Use: https://www.home-assistant.io/components/integration/ and https://www.home-assistant.io/components/utility_meter/

* Everything listed in https://github.com/rospogrigio/localtuya-homeassistant/issues/15

# Thanks to:

NameLessJedi https://github.com/NameLessJedi/localtuya-homeassistant and mileperhour https://github.com/mileperhour/localtuya-homeassistant being the major sources of inspiration, and whose code for switches is substantially unchanged.

TradeFace, for being the only one to provide the correct code for communication with the cover (in particular, the 0x0d command for the status instead of the 0x0a, and related needs such as double reply to be received): https://github.com/TradeFace/tuya/

sean6541, for the working (standard) Python Handler for Tuya devices.

postlund, for the ideas, for coding 95% of the refactoring and boosting the quality of this repo to levels hard to imagine (by me, at least) and teaching me A LOT of how things work in Home Assistant.
